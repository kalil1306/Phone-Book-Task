# Kalil's Phonebook directory

This project Phone Book is purely to understand about the functionality of, Hoe the contact
book works in mobile application and how the features is bieng used my the mobile but this totally depends on MongoDB Database and Python based project.
In this project certain features provided to create a contact and validate some functionality 
for unique mobile number, validation of contact name as contact id it also be the unique values and the validation of mobile number like starts with 0|91 followed by mobile number as starts with 6 to 9 followed by 9 numbers
these functionaly validation has been validated with the help of python regular expression and Mongo Regex(Regular expression).
when the contact book has been created by the user it will print or take you to whole contact list as Dataframe with the help of pandas.
Then user has the ability to search for a contact for example if the user name starts with kalil and in the phone book database kalil has 
4 names like(kalil1, kalil2, kalil3, kalil4) the search functionality will gives you all the contact names starts with kalil.
The Third functionality in this phone book project is updating the existing contact phone number
with the help of accurate contact id that is contact name and the last functionality is deleting the existing contact from the phone book database with the help of mongoDN query
in this case I have used a tkinter package for populating the new window when the user selects the deleting option
tkinter will triggers the confirmation dialog box for the user to ask the confirmation from user to delete it or not these are all the overview of this project.
